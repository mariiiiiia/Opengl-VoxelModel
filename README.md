This app implements .obj Rendering, Voxelization in different resolutions, Re-triangulation (this is BETA), rendering voxels as spheres and simulating free falling with gravity force and collisions between spheres themselves and the room.

q-w, a-s, z-x: move object on x,y,z axes

o-p, k-l, n-m: rotate object 

t: put texture
u: undo putting texture

1: render object '1' 
2: render object '2'
3: render object '3'
4: render object '4'

right-click inside the window and select your menu choices

d: voxel model
e: undo voxelization
+: increase voxel widths -> decrease the definition. There are 5 possible voxel width values, that rotate pushing '+'.

r: voxels become spheres
f: let the sphere-voxels fall down by the force of gravity

j: retriangulation
i: undo re-triangulation

space: rewind free fall

D: TEST->voxelize a single triangle to verify the process
